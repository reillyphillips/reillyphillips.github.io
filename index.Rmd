A Bit About Me
---------
Hi, my name is Reilly! I am a junior at Appalachian State University getting my Bachelor's degree in General Mathematics with a minor in Spanish. I love animals and have been a vegetarian for 11 years now, with most of my family being vegetarian as well. I love England, London in particular, and plan to move after finishing my education!
